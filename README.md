Forked from https://github.com/hw-tinkerers/TR-60

The intention is to use the electrical design parts (schematic/chip layout) of the original TR-60 project while replacing the physical format. Final format will be similar to the Logitech G915/G915X. Similar keyboards are:
-Redragon K618 PRO
-Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro
-Corsair K100

One of these will be used as a donor for the chassis and needed physical parts.
