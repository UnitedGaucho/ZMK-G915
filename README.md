Forked from https://github.com/hw-tinkerers/TR-60

The intention was to use the electrical design parts (schematic/chip layout) of the original TR-60 project while replacing the physical format, however, many things have changed and very little of the original design is left.

The volume wheel, media buttons, and full-size-ness of the G915-like keyboards are must-have features. The inability to choose my own key switches is a must not have. Therefore, using the chassis of a G915 (or similar) and replacing the pcb is my best bet.

Final format will either be or be similar to the Logitech G915/G915X. Similar keyboards are:
-Redragon K618 PRO
-Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro
-Corsair K100

One of these will be used as a donor for the chassis and needed physical parts. I have a donor G915, hence being the first target.

This project is under development and nothing in it should be considered a working design.

Features to be implemented:
-ZMK Firmware as base. Custom modules/libraries as required.
-Rotary encoder for volume wheel
-per-key rgb backlight
-USB-C connector but no Power Delivery (PD)
